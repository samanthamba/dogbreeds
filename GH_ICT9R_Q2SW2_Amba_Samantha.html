	<dd>What a cute big baby! Newfoundland Dogs are the sweetest as they are also gentle despite their huge size. Which makes them a great "nanny" for kids. They are also very loyal and incredibly easy to train due to their docile nature. These dogs are also strong swimmers and are even trained to rescue people from drowning.</dd>

		<dd>These fluffy bears are powerful and are built dogs as high as 20 inches at the shoulder. Some of their distinctive traits include a lion's-mane around their heads and shoulders; blue-black tongues; deep almond eyes that add to their snobbish expressions; and a stiff-legged gait. Chows can have either a rough or a smooth coat of red, back, blue, cinnamon, or cream. Most ownersw say that Chows are the cleanest of dogs; housebreak easily, have little dog odor, and are known to be like cats. If a Chow is well-socialized, it will never be feirce or intractable, instead will be refined and dignified. They're mostly aloof with strangers and forever loyal to loved ones. They're also serene and adaptable, no need for special exercises and are happy in the city life.</dd>

		<dd>Finally, one of my most favorite dog breeds! These Goldens are simply too lovely to not have. They are great companion dogs that would rather sleep at your feet than play outside without you. These dogs are incredibly well-tempered and are definately safe around children. They are also great service and comfort dogs because of how tolerant their attitudes are which makes them very friendly. Not to mention, these dogs are great for outdoor activities since they were bread to retrieve ducks and other fowl. So if you like games like fetch, Golden Retrievers are the one for you.</dd>
